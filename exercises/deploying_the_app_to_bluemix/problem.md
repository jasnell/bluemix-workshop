Deloying the App to Bluemix

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

Now that your application has been developed and configured for use with
Bluemix, it's time to deploy! Simply type `cf push` and your application will
be deployed to Bluemix. Uploading, building, and launching your application
could take a few minutes. Once it's done, run `{appname} verify
{bluemix-appname}` where `{bluemix-appname}` is the name you selected for your
application in `manifest.yml`.
